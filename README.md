# Telco-customer-churn-prediction-ml
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecom company based on customer data. It employs logistic regression and random forest classifiers, with SMOTE for handling class imbalance. The model evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to improve customer retention strategies.
